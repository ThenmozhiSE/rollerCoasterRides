Morning Coffee

Adithya was in the front portico, with a mesmerizing coffee in her hand and a new plot for her character Ryder in her dreamland. She is fond of that place ever since her childhood. The portico had watched her grow up from an infant to the women, till date. She was brought back to earth, when her son, Dhruv screeched for getting her attention to the glass scratch in his pink-baby fingers.

Adithya took Dhruv to her lap, sung his favorite lullaby, and finally, Dhruv gave up his capricious cry and giggled along with her. Adithya tucked him to bed and caught the glimpses of his scratches, which reminded her acerbic scars deep in the heart. She returned to her spot and closed her eyes to land on her own dreamland, but she got into her past. She let her boat sail along the direction of the wind and smiled to herself, thinking about the plays of fate.

She wondered about the differences in her-self then and now. She saw a girl tempted to the ‘media’ industry, just like a moth allured to the fire, who failed to look ahead into the future with the responsibility factors, being exerted by her family, nonetheless, she was a bustling impulsive girl with distinction grades. Her conceding nature gave up media in-front of her orthodox family nuptial rules.

Adithya invested her time and soul in unfurling her ‘self’ by discerning her apocryphal thoughts into lucid ideas.She obliterated the chaos in head and invigorated her heart with optimistic lines of thinking. Her transition gave her the fruit – Adithya, the independent novelist.

Adithya admires her new-self, who is not still an allured moth to the flame but understands the actualities around her and hold on to her responsibilities. Here, she frames her daily routines in accordance with the same orthodox rules, but her transition made her revise them, whenever necessary and possible.
